# Occupancy prediction of a commercial building
This repository aims to construct a model based on building automation system data for occupancy pattern estimation.

The estimated occupancy pattern will validate with the data from the entrance gate.

The results of this repository imply that CO2 sensors can be good occupancy detectors rather than only monitoring IAQ.
