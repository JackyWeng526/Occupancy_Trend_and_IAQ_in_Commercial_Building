# Occupancy prediction of a commercial building
This repository aims to construct a model based on building automation system data for occupancy pattern estimation.

The estimated occupancy pattern will validate with the data from the entrance gate.

The results of this repository imply that CO2 sensors are good occupancy detectors rather than only tools for monitoring IAQ.
